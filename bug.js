This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically when attempting to store or retrieve large amounts of data. The error message might not be explicit, but it often manifests as unexpected behavior, such as the app freezing or crashing, or data not being saved correctly.  It's not a syntax error; rather, it's a limitation of AsyncStorage, which is not designed for handling large data sets efficiently.  The root cause is AsyncStorage's in-memory limitations and lack of optimized data handling for massive data.
